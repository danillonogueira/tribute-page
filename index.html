					<p id="p3">Dr. Peterson and his colleagues have also produced two online programs to help people understand their personalities and improve their lives. The newest, <a href="https://www.understandmyself.com/" target="_blank">UnderstandMyself</a>, provides its users with detailed information about their personalities, based on work he published with his students <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.513.2517&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Tens of thousands have now used it to determine who they are, and to help others understand them, as well. His original self-analysis program, the <a href="http://selfauthoring.com/" target="_blank">Self Authoring Suite</a>, (featured in <a href="http://www.oprah.com/spirit/self-authoring-health-benefits-of-writing" target="_blank">O: The Oprah Magazine</a>, CBC radio, and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives" target="_blank">NPR’s national website</a>), has helped over 200,000 people resolve the problems of their past, rectify their personality faults and enhance their virtues, and radically improve their future. Research documenting the program’s effectiveness can be found <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/jacobhirsh/publications/GoalSettingJAP2010.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279224047_A_scalable_goal-setting_intervention_closes_both_the_gender_and_ethnic_minority_achievement_gap" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br />
